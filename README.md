## Data
The corpus data published here consists of a subsample of data collected and annotated by the [Kola Saami Documentation Project](http://dobes.mpi.nl/projects/sami/) and subsequent projects. Conventions for data structure and annotations are found in our [FRechdoc repository](https://github.com/langdoc/FRechdoc/).

Also linked multimedia data - if available - is only found in the archive.
